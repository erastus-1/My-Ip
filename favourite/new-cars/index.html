      <h2>New cars</h2>
        <p> If you’re in the market for your first car, you may be tempted to buy a new one. After all, a new car has many perks, and these perks go beyond superficial qualities, like glossy paint or the classic new-car smell.</p>
      <h2>What are the best offers this coming month:</h2>
      <img src="" alt="image on a ford-150XL XT">
        <p>Ahead of the redesigned 2021 F-150 pickup truck hitting dealerships this fall, the outgoing 2020 model averaged 77 days at the selling dealer through most of August. Ford is offering big discounts on the work-truck XL and mainstream XLT trims, which together account for roughly three-fourths of new model-year 2020 F-150 inventory on Cars.com as of this writing.
           Depending on region, cash on the hood ranges from $4,000 to $5,000 on the XL and $5,250 to $6,250 on the XLT. Those amounts should drive double-digit percentage discounts for many shoppers, and they’re far higher than the advertised incentives on pricier trim levels of the pickup truck, which max out at just $2,500 in the markets we surveyed. Alternatively, Ford is offering 5.9% financing for 84 months to creditworthy shoppers for the XL and XLT.</p>
