      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For first-time buyers there’s a key dilemma: Should I buy a new vehicle or a used vehicle? Or should I take the third path, certified pre-owned? Ruiru motive got you covered. </p>
        <p> If you’re in the market for your first car, you may be tempted to buy a new one. After all, a new car has many perks, and these perks go beyond superficial qualities, like glossy paint or the classic new-car smell.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, first-time car buyers are looking for a vehicle that doesn’t cost a lot of money. A used car is, then, a good option. Used cars offer huge savings, and that factor alone led shoppers to buy 2.5 used cars for every new car in 2014. But used-car shopping is a trickier process.</p>
        <p>If you’re a first-time buyer and you want a good compromise between the benefits of a brand-new vehicle and a used one, a certified pre-owned car may be the vehicle for you. All major automakers offer certified pre-owned programs, and they typically involve significant reconditioning, multipoint inspections and warranty extensions. Automakers seldom certify cars that have more than 80,000 miles or are older than 6 years old. So any CPO car is, by definition, low mileage and not too old.</p>
